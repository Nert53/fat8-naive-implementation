# FAT8 naive implementation
This task was final for subject "Operating System 2" on Department of Science on Palacky University in Olomouc.
You can find the task description in file `zapocet-zadani.pdf` (it is czech). For disk I choose the second option
with classic read/write operations and making another layer over it for caching.

Demonstration of how it works can be find in `main.py`. Or you can test it on your own by calling methods as are 
descripted in pdf file. For viewing the "disk" I recommend some hex dump editor
(in my case it was extesion `BinEd - Binary/Hex Editor from Miroslav Hajda`).
